# Script Moved to https://github.com/microsoft/CSS-Exchange

## Purpose
The script is self-explanatory. You can test run diskshadow on a single Exchange database to ensure backups are working properly (i.e. all the Microsoft components). If the issue only happens with a 3rd-party backup solution, you can utilize operation mode 2 to enable just the logging while you execute a backup with the 3rd-party solution.
